# TwitchShipGame
Twitch chat integrated game

# Initial Notes:
2D Fighting Auto Battler with Battle Royale.
Driven by channel point & chat interactions.

Using a dubloon reward will allow viewers to create a 'crew' or ship.
This will then chill at the bottom of the viewport until a battle starts.
Other viewers can choose to create ships of their own, or join an existing crew. 
Size of the ship will increase as more crewmates join in.
* Optionally, we will evenly distribute crew from the chatters.

Random treasure chest sprites will appear during the game and collection will increase the stats of the ships in some way. 
Levelling & progression system will be great. Would be really nice if we can centralise that on a server somewhere and share it between streams.

Different types of commands can be used during a 'battle'.
!block and !attack are examples, but the command context is unclear currently.

On killstreak, you can 'turn into a dragon'

Skins would be great for level up rewards / doubloons rewards.
Idling will have some effect on the fighting. 

Potentially many ships can be roaming around the screen during a 'fighting phase', collecting treasure and levelling up. 

We will try to grab the icon of the user who started the crew, to paint that as a sprite onto the sails of the ship.
